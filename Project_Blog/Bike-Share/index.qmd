Data analysis, or more like, persistence seems to be the key to understanding. Quite a lot was learned, perhaps approaching the full-stack of web development, in terms of software engineering. A combination of research, testing, database design, front-end web development, and statistical programming brought this project fully home. The dataset itself is real, anonymized, data.

I took inspiration from a lot of past learning in how I approached this dataset. It struck me as odd that I had not been applying most of my skill-set very much. Much of my workplace experience had been with Excel up to this point, or by just writing down formulas by hand in the lab. I would say that Excel is quite deep and useful in the general workplace. However, the weight of the experiences from many CS courses over the years, which introduced me to [:a boring list of langs I learned](#LangsList), were too much to ignore. In short, it was time to take things to the next level and take a big step towards long-held goals. ðŸ¥…

I will likely update this project from time to time, then probably less as time goes on and I utilize more of my skill set in the sciences on future projects. That said, I disclose that my degree is in Chemistry, technically, though I think engineering makes things more fun. Engineering and science should have never been separated into distinct four-year degrees in education, honestly. Perhaps this project helps chip away the bridge that divides.

Though likely fate hath so ordain'd, \
That I shall ride upon two wheels again.*[^1]]{.text-center}
