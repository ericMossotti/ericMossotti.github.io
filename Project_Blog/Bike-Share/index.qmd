Persistent data analysis proved the key to understanding. Substantial knowledge was gained, resembling some level of full-stack web development proficiency. A combination of research, testing, database design, front-end development, and statistical programming brought this project home. The substantial effort was worthwhile, I'd say.

I took inspiration from a wealth of past learning experiences in approaching this dataset. However, it struck me as peculiar that I had not been extensively applying the majority of my skill set. Much of my workplace experience had been confined to Excel or manually writing formulas in the lab. While Excel is undoubtedly a powerful and valuable tool in the general workplace, the cumulative experiences from numerous computer science courses over the years, which introduced me to [[:a boring list of langs I learned](#LangsList)]{style="color: red"}, were too significant to ignore. In essence, it was time to elevate things to the next level and take a big stride towards longstanding goals. ðŸ¥…

I will likely periodically update and refine this project, though the frequency of updates may diminish over time. My mind wanders towards other datasets that can more comprehensively leverage my background and expertise in the natural and physical sciences. It's worth noting that, although my major is technically in chemistry, I find engineering adds engagement and believe that the separation of science and engineering into distinct four-year degrees was an unfortunate division. Perhaps this project can contribute to bridging the gap between these two intertwined disciplines.
